#Typings-youtube-api-search

This is a type definition file for the [youtube search api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-api-search) library.
It's really useful if you are trying to do the [react redux udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) in typescript or just using vscode.

I won't really be adding this to the registry so install it with the command `typings install github:andrew-w-ross/typings-youtube-api-search -n youtube-api-search --ambient -S`
